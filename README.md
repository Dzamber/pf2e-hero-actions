# FoundryVTT PF2e Hero Actions

This module integrates and automates the `Hero Deck` actions into the PF2e system.

It adds a new section in the `actions` tab of the character sheet where a player can **Draw**, **Discard** or **Use** `Hero Actions` in concert with the regular `Hero Points`.

It works as follow:

-   If the character has more `Hero Points` than `Hero Actions`, the player will be asked to **Draw** new `Hero Actions` to fill in.

-   If the character has more `Hero Actions` than `Hero Points`, the player will be asked to **Discard** the excess of `Hero Actions`.

-   Otherwise the player will have the opportunity to **Use** any `Hero Actions` that are available to them, doing so will also spend one `Hero Point` from the character pool.

The GM has two options for the draws:

-   Random draw where characters could end up receiving the same `Hero Action` than another character or even multiple times the same one themselves.

-   A unique deck table from which characters will all **Draw**, no duplicates until the whole pool is emptied (the table will automatically be created in the world if none exist).
